## Overview

The Weather Dashboard app is designed to offer users a comprehensive view of the current weather for a specified city, along with relevant news articles from NYT related to that city. Users can easily search for a city, and the app fetches both weather and news data in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Bootstrap for styling
  - Font Awesome for icons
  - Fetch API for data retrieval

- **Back-End:**
  - OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
  - The New York Times Article Search API for news articles

## How It Works

1. **Weather Data:**
   - Users input a city name in the search bar.
   - The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for the specified city.

2. **News Articles:**
   - Simultaneously, the app uses the NYT Article Search API to retrieve relevant news articles related to the entered city.

3. **Integration:**
   - The weather information and news articles are displayed side by side, providing a holistic view for the user.
